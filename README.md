# DotNetPWA
A repository for my future dotnet projects to assist me in configuration.

## Basic Useage
- Install dotnet 9 via [offical server](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download). 
- Install node/npm via [official source](https://nodejs.org/en).
- Open a terminal in a folder of your choosing.
- `git clone https://github.com/zackmorgs/DotNetPWA.git`
- `npm install`
- `npm run watch`

This will launch the API server as well as the PWA server. Navigate to the weather page to test functionality.
